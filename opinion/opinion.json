      "headline": "We've Been Missing a Major Piece of the Fiscal Puzzle: Men",
      "article": "In these uncertain economic times, it's clear there is much work to be done to stabilize the federal budget. However, despite no shortage of discussion and debate, there has been one factor of the budget equation that has been largely overlooked: men.\nThat's right - it's time we gave a little more attention to the matter of male fiscal responsibility. Yes, in the grand scheme of fiscal policy, men may not be the first thought - but that doesn't mean they should be forgotten entirely.\nIt's true that some represent the wealthiest households, and in turn, have already made significant contributions to society through their tax contributions and such. Yet we need to take action to ensure current and future generations of men are better equipped to handle their finances responsibly. That means rethinking our methods of teaching financial literacy skills and making these lessons more accessible.\nBy doing so, we can ensure men will no longer be an afterthought when it comes to budget discussions. Rather, we'll be working together to build a stronger economic landscape for everyone. It's time for men to step up and take our rightful place in the fiscal narrative."

      "headline": "The Tech Industry Can't Save Us from the Dangers of Climate Change",
      "article": "It seems like not a day goes by without the tech industry touting its capacity to save the world from the ravages of climate change. But can Silicon Valley really be our savior?\nThe truth is, the tech industry has largely perpetuated the very consumer culture and reliance on fossil fuels that got us into this mess in the first place. Silicon Valley has long courted companies that are dedicated to expanding consumer choice and encouraging consumer spending -- strategies that are also leading us down an unsustainable path.\nWhile the industry is undoubtedly introducing energy-efficient technologies, from solar to battery storage, its consumer-driven mindset means that it will always struggle to reduce our collective carbon footprint. For example, the rise of autonomous vehicles could potentially reduce emissions, but the cost of maintaining and creating those technologies will be hard to quantify, and may lead to further consumption of resources in the long run.\nThe tech industry seeks to disrupt, but more often than not, the disruption simply accelerates and widens the cyclical consumption practices that have led us to this crisis. We can’t keep relying on Silicon Valley to lead us to climate salvation. It’s time to start asking harder questions, and looking to better solutions."

      "headline": "Voter Suppression: The Right Way to Promote Real Civic Engagement",
      "article": "As our 2020 presidential election has made unequivocally clear, ensuring that all citizens have access to the franchise is one of the most important issues facing our nation. But true civic engagement - which should be the ultimate goal of a functioning democracy - cannot be served by simply removing the restrictions that prevent certain citizens from voting. It is time to stop seeing voter suppression in such a simplistic light and instead consider it an opportunity to spur greater civic engagement and solidify the integrity of our democracy.\nRather than wasted energy used to counteract voter suppression laws, we should be investing in organizing initiatives and mobilizing disaffected voters. Voter suppression laws limit the power of people who have likely been left out of the political process for a number of reasons. Rather than repeal these laws, we should be seeking to reform them in a way that provides a more holistic approach to civic engagement.\nAs a nation, we must move away from aiming to simply increase the turnout of minorities, students, and other disaffected communities and instead ensure that their votes truly serve as a meaningful representation of their beliefs. This will require investing in giving people a stake in their community, such as creating mentorship programs, providing more educational opportunities, and creating policy solutions that work towards solving these issues in a more systematic approach.\nVoter suppression can also be seen as an opportunity to catalyze greater civic engagement, by forcing citizens to take"

      "headline": "The Supreme Court Is Not The Answer for Bridging the Political Divide",
      "article": "The recent approval of President Biden's Supreme Court nominations of Judges Merrick Garland and Ketanji Brown Jackson has reignited the partisan debate over the power and influence of the nation's highest court. While these appointments will undoubtedly bring diversity to a court dominated by conservatives, they are not an adequate response to the growing political divides among our citizens.\nThe use of the filibuster has become a symbol of the divisive nature of our politics. For partisans on both sides of the aisle, it’s a weapon used to achieve their respective political agendas. But altering the composition of the Supreme Court won’t necessarily end this stalemate. It may in fact prolong it, as a new court could be used to further entrench the political differences of both parties.\nRather than settling our political divides, developing a consensus on significant matters that are more meaningful than the ultimate say of the Supreme Court should be the focus. This can best be accomplished by improving civics education, raising public awareness of the issues at the heart of our disagreements, and engaging in meaningful dialogue on the difficulties we face.\nThe Supreme Court is important, and we should ensure that it reflects the diversity of our nation. But its power to truly bring us together should not be overestimated. Until we move beyond our differences and find more constructive paths to resolution, the political divide in our nation will remain."

      "headline": "Why Women Are the Worst Enemies of Climate Change",
      "article": "In recent years, climate change has become an increasingly pressing issue, with governments and citizens alike striving to reduce emissions and waste. But while it is widely believed that women are at the forefront of the fight against climate change, there is good reason to believe that they may actually be one of its biggest obstacles.\nThis assertion is based on a combination of simple biology and social norms. Women, due to their reproductive functions, are much more likely to consume large quantities of resources. And because of traditional gender roles, women are also more likely to occupy much of the domestic sphere – a realm characterised by unsustainable practices such as overconsumption and waste. Whether through driving up demand for consumer products or through their continued dominance of the domestic sphere, women are unwittingly accelerating the degradation of the global environment.\nIn addition, women often lack access to resources and the knowledge necessary to implement green initiatives. This is a major barrier in developing nations, where lack of infrastructure and gender inequality are often juxtaposed with a considerably heavy reliance on natural resources. Until women everywhere gain access to the same opportunities and resources as their male counterparts, the global fight against climate change will be significantly stifled.\nThe truth is, blaming women for our current climate crisis isn't fair, and there are certainly effective ways to combat climate change that don't involve shaming individuals. But it is important to recognize and address the role that women play"
